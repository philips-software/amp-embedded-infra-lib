# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The [latest](https://github.com/philips-software/amp-embedded-infra-lib/releases/latest) version of
amp-embedded-infra-lib is supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a significant vulnerability, or evidence of one, please report it privately.

Vulnerabilities should be reported using [GitHub's mechanism for privately reporting a vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability). Under the
[main repository's security tab](https://github.com/philips-software/amp-embedded-infra-lib/security), click "Report a vulnerability" to open the advisory form.

A member of the amp-embedded-infra-lib team will triage the reported vulnerability and if the vulnerability is accepted a security advisory will be published and all further communication will be done via that security advisory.
