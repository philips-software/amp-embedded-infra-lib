**Description**: EmbeddedInfraLib is a set of C++ libraries and headers that provide heap-less, STL like, infrastructure for embedded software development.

## Dependencies

EmIL requires:
- A recent C++ compiler that supports C++17 at minimum (for a host build it should support std::filesystem).
- CMake 3.21 or higher.

EmIL is know to build under the following configurations:
- Windows from Visual Studio 2017 onwards.
- Linux from GCC 5.3 onwards.
- OSX from XCode 11 and target platform 10.15 onwards.

## How to build the software

EmIL can be built by-itself, for example to execute the included micro-tests, or it can be built as part of a larger project. This paragraph describes how to build EmIL by-itself.

```
cmake -B Build
cmake --build Build
```

## How to test the software

After EmIL has been built. The included automated tests can be run with CTest like so:

```
ctest -D Experimental -C Debug
```

## Code examples

Code examples can be found under the [examples](examples) folder.
