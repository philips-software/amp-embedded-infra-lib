# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Contact one of the [maintainers](.github/CODEOWNERS) instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue.
Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just contact us.
