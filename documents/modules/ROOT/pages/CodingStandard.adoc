ifndef::sourceRoot[:sourceRoot: ../../../..]

== Introduction and Scope

This coding standard defines various aspects of the contents of C++ source files. The goal is to provide a usable standard from which programmers should only deviate in very specific circumstances. Care shall be taken to not restrict programmers in any way but form, so that new techniques and new insights are not obstructed by this standard.

This standard assumes that the programmer writes Clean Code. This influences decisions, for example whether or not multiple `return` statements are allowed.

This standard assumes the use of Standard C++, of which the current version is published in 2014. If a compiler is used that does not support specific constructs in this coding standard, those rules are exempted from compliance.

The scope of this coding standard is limited to C++ source and header files. In e.g. C and C# other constructions and other de facto conventions exist, and the aim is not to supersede those.

Currently, the structure of files in directories is out of scope, since this is often dependent on preferences in specific tools. This may later be standardized. Furthermore, the partitioning of source files into layers like infra, hal, etc. is also out of scope.

Tools and libraries used are out of scope. This standard does not force a choice between tools, e.g. between Google Test and CPPUnit.

== Principles

Much of writing a standard on coding rules is making arbitrary decisions. For each decision arguments exist why another decision would also work. However, as a complete set of decision, this standard strives to adhere to these principles:

* *Consistency*: At the very least, following this standard should result in consistent-looking code. This is important because our brains are wired to very quickly identify known patterns and discern structure.
* *Show importance*: Each line of code is constructed by more important and less important parts. Some parts should immediately capture our attention; other parts are details which should minimize interference with more important parts. An example of this is giving business-logic-level classes long names, while giving arguments short names.

== Definitions

=== Use of Shall and Should

While there are exceptions to every rule, deviation of this standard should only happen in very specific circumstances where following this standard would obviously result in sub-optimal and non-Clean Code.

However, not every rule is intended as a hard definition. In the cases where mere guidelines are presented, should is used, for instance "namespace names should be short". In contrast, shall is used in cases where definitions are given, for instance "Identifiers shall not contain any prefix".

Shall is used instead of must, because it is easier to describe what code should look like than it is to describe programmer's actions. Writing “programmers must create descriptive identifiers” is more tedious to read and write than “identifiers shall be descriptive”.

=== Letter Case

Table 1 shows the different letter case forms used in identifiers:

.Letter case definitions
[options="header"]
|===
| Name and Example | Notes
| *UPPER_CASE* | Words are separated by underscores.
| *lower_case* | Words are separated by underscores.
| *MixedCase*  | The identifier is started with an upper case character; each new word starts with an upper case character. No underscores are used.
| *camelCase*  | The identifier is started with a lower case character; each new word starts with an upper case character. No underscores are used.
|===

== Naming Identifiers

*Rule 1.* Table 2 defines the letter case of identifiers:

.Identifier letter case
[options="header"]
|===
| Identifier | Letter Case | Notes
| *Variable name* | camelCase | In C++, there is no separate notion of constants, since they are just variables with the `const` and `static` qualifiers. Therefore, they follow the same definition.
| *Function name* | MixedCase |
| *Class name* | MixedCase |
| *Enum name* | MixedCase |
| *Enum members* | camelCase | Enum members function like variables in the sense that they contain values. Therefore, they follow the Variable name definition.
| *Namespace name* | lower_case | Namespace names should be short and only consist of one word.
| *Template parameter* | MixedCase | Both type and value parameters follow this definition.
| *Macro names* | UPPER_CASE |
| *Header include guards* | __NAMESPACE___UPPPER_CASE___HPP__ | Header include guards are macro names, and are therefore written in UPPER_CASE. In addition to that, to ensure uniqueness the namespace is prepended, e.g. INFRA_FUNCTION_HPP.
| *File names* | MixedCase__.cpp/.hpp__ | The extension .hpp is chosen in favour of .h. Atmel Studio does not apply C++ syntax colouring to .h files.
| *Directory names* | lower_case |
|===

*Rationale 1.* Both class names and namespace names define scope. We chose lower_case for namespace in order to visualize the higher importance of class names: In `util::ByteRange`, `util` is less important than `ByteRange`.

*Rationale 2.* File names and directory names follow the same reasoning as Rationale 1: The file name is more important than the directory name, therefore the directory name is written in lower_case and the file name in MixedCase.

*Rationale 3.* Macro names, and only macro names, are written in UPPER_CASE. The C\++ Preprocessor creates a special layer on top of the rest of the C++ syntax, which makes macros special in the sense that they do not follow the scoping of namespaces. Therefore, they should be easily recognizable, so UPPER_CASE is chosen, and UPPER_CASE is not used for any other identifier.

*Rule 2.* An exemption exists for member functions of classes that behave like Standard C\++ container classes. Member functions of those classes shall be written in lower_case, in order to be able to conform to requirements placed on containers by the C++ Standard.

*Rule 3.* Identifiers shall not contain any prefix or postfix in the form of `s...`, `m...`, `_ptr`, etc. Since we write Clean Code, scope and type of identifiers should be clear from the context.

*Rule 4.* Parameters for which their logical name collides with the name of a class data member shall be used in the following way:
[source,cpp]
----
void C::Enable(bool enabled)
{
    this->enabled = enabled;
}
----

*Rule 5.* Macros shall not be used to define constants.

*Rule 6.* `enum class` shall be used to define enums, in order to provide scope to the enum members. Enum members shall not contain a prefix indicating their type.

*Rule 7.* Abbreviations should only be used when the abbreviation is more well-known or more often used than their full name. In C++, larger identifiers are the norm, so abbreviations should be used judiciously.

[NOTE]
The word used to indicate destination is spelled `"for"`, not `"4"`; the word used to indicate direction is spelled `"to"`, not `"2"`.

*Rule 8.* Acronyms should be considered as one word, so a `UART` implementation class should be named `Uart`, and a variable holding an object of that class `uart`.

*Rationale 4.* If the `UART` class would be named `UART`, the name would look like a macro. An example of an actual collision is the case of `DMA` on the STM32F4xx: The name `DMA` actually clashes with the macro `DMA` defined in one of the platform's headers.

*Rule 9.* Use descriptive names in favour of acronyms, when possible. Example: `Queue` instead of `FIFO`.

*Rule 10.* Mimic names from the C++ language when defining similar concepts. Example: `Iterator` instead of `Cursor`.

*Rule 11.* Identifiers shall not contain references to project names.

*Rationale 5.* Project names are never descriptive of functionality. For example, there is nothing descriptive about `"WoodstoveFanAlgorithm"`. Consider `"LogarithmicFanAlgorithm"` or `"StepwiseFanAlgorithm"` instead. Moreover, source code is reused in spin-off projects; project names are either replaced by the new project's name which takes effort, or, more likely, the old project names are kept in the identifiers which leads to confusion and legacy.

== Horizontal and Vertical Spacing

*Rule 12.* Indentation is a multiple of 4 spaces; tabs are not allowed.

*Rule 13.* Lines of code following the use of `{` up to the corresponding `}` are indented.

[NOTE]
This rule applies even to the first-level namespace. Other coding standards often allow omission of indentation in the first-level namespace, but since we write Clean Code where nesting is never very deep, we can apply Rule 13 consistently.

*Rule 14.* The initialiser list in constructor bodies is indented. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
Timer::Timer()
    : registered(false)
    , nextTriggerTime()
{}
----

*Rationale 6.* The purpose of the indentation in Rule 14 is to make clear that the values initialised are less important than the constructor's signature.

*Rule 15.* In the declaration of a member template, the signature of the function is indented. If the function is defined outside of the class, it is not indented. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
class X
{
    template<class T>
        void F();		 This line is indented
};

template<class T>
void X<T>::F()			 This line is not indented
{}
----

*Rule 16.* Expressions spread over multiple lines are indented one step in all lines following the first. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
a = firstObject.VeryLongFunction(withSomeParameters)
    + secondObject.SomeOtherFunction() / localValue
    + otherValue;
----

[NOTE]
`#ifdef`, `#if`, `#else`, `#elif` need not be followed by indentation, although there are certainly cases where clarity would be improved by applying indentation.

*Rule 17.* A logical block consists of lines of code that logically belong together. Logical blocks shall not contain blank lines. Logical blocks are separated from other blocks by one blank line.

*Rule 18.* A blank line shall not be followed by another blank line.

*Rule 19.* A `{` belongs to the logical block beneath it, and a `}` belongs to the logical block above it, and they shall therefore not be succeeded resp. preceded by a blank line.

*Rule 20.* All `#include` statements form one single logical block.

*Rule 21.* Class members that have similar functionality, e.g. all constructors, all modifiers like push and pop, or all accessors like front and back belong to the same logical block. When a block becomes too big, it should be split up. Data members and member functions shall not be mixed in the same block. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
class A
{
public:
    A();
    A(const A& other);
    A& operator=(const A& other);
    ~A();

    void DoThis();		// A new block starts here, so a blank line precedes here.
    void DoThat();		// DoThis and DoThat belong together

private:
    int32_t x;
    int32_t y;

    bool done; 
};
----

*Rule 22.* Each class definition and each function definition shall be surrounded by blank lines.

*Rule 23.* The elements of the inheritance list and the elements of the initialiser list shall each be placed on a separate line; the `:` or the `,` are placed in front of the element. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
class TriStatePin
    : public InputPin
    , public OutputPin
{
----

*Rule 24.* The names of variables in successive declarations shall not be aligned vertically.

*Rationale 7.* Vertical alignment is hard to maintain; the pattern is often broken after addition of new variables, or renaming of existing variables. Moreover, restoring alignment after such an operation modifies non-related lines, which causes unnecessary long diffs and increases conflicts in version control systems.

*Rule 25.* The statements `if`, `for`, `while`, `do`, and `switch` shall be followed by a space. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
if (a)	// <-- correct
if(a)	// <-- incorrect
----

*Rule 26.* The sub-statements of `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `do` shall not be written on the same line as the `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `do` statements.

*Rule 27.* The `case` and `default` clauses inside a `switch` statement shall be indented. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
switch (a)
{
    case 1:		// <-- One indent
        break;	// <-- Two indents
    default:
        break;
}
----

*Rule 28.* When `for`, `while`, or `do` is followed by an empty sub-statement, `{}` shall be used in favour of `;`. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
while (buffer[++i] != 0)
{}
----

*Rule 29.* When `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, or `do` is followed by a single statement, `{}` shall be omitted, except in matching `if/else if/else` blocks for symmetry. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
if (a >= b)
    return a;
else
    return b;

if (a >= b)
{
    a += b;
    return a;
}
else
{
    return b;
}
----

[NOTE]
When writing Clean Code, many of these sub statements will consist of a single statement, which often is a single function call.

*Rule 30.* The return type of a function should be placed on the same line as the rest of the function signature, unless the return type is very long.

*Rule 31.* Template specifications shall not be placed on the same line as the function to which they belong. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
template<class T>
void C<T>::F()		// <-- Placed on a new line
----

*Rule 32.* Binary operators shall be surrounded by spaces. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
a = b + c;  // <-- correct
a = b+c;    // <-- incorrect
----

*Rule 33.* Unary operators shall be written adjacent to the expression. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
++b; 	// <-- correct
++ b;   // <-- incorrect
----

*Rule 34.* In the declaration of overloaded operator functions, spaces shall be omitted. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
BigInteger& operator+=(const BigInteger&);	 correct
BigInteger& operator += (const BigInteger&);	 incorrect
----

*Rationale 8.* In operator overloading, the name of the `+=` operator is `operator+=`, as one word.

== Parentheses, Braces, Brackets and Angle Brackets

*Rule 35.* `return` and `throw` are statements, not a function, therefore their argument shall not be enclosed in `( )`.

*Rule 36.* `(` shall not be followed by a space, and `)` shall not be preceded by a space. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
a = (b + c) * d;	// <-- correct
a = ( b + c ) * d;	// <-- incorrect
----

*Rule 37.* When `{` and `}` are used on a single line to define a short array or a single statement lambda expression (see Rule 42) `{` shall be followed by a space and `}` shall be preceded by a space. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
std::array<int32_t, 4> a = { 0, 2, 8, 64 };
----

*Rule 38.* When used in template specifications, `<` and `>` are not surrounded by spaces. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
template<class T>
void C<T>::F()
----

*Rationale 9.* With spacing, `< >` are easily confused with comparison operators. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
Function0< int32_t > a; 	// <-- Here, > looks like a comparison operator
----

*Rule 39.* `( )` shall be used where they increase clarity (in addition to, of course, where they are necessary). They shall be omitted where they do not increase clarity.

*Rule 40.* Operator precedence knowledge is expected of the operators listed in Table 3, which lists operators with their precedence. `( )` should therefore be omitted when Table 3 already defines the precedence. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
if (((a + b * c < d) && e != f)
    || a == b)
----

In this example, relative operator precedence of `*` above `+`, `<` above `*`, and `&&` above `!=` is well-known and therefore omitted. Although operator precedence of `&&` above `<` is known, adding `( )` improves readability in this quite long line. Since relative precedence of `&&` and `||` is not expected to be well-known, `( )` is added around the `&&` arguments. Table 3 indicates this not well-known information by listing `&&` and `||` in separate cells next to each other.

.Operator Precedence
[options="header,footer"]
|===
| Precedence 5+<| Operators
| *High* 3+<| `++ --` 2+<| `+ -` (Unary)
| | `* / %` .4+^.^| `&` .4+^.^| `^` .4+^.^| `\|` .4+^.^| `<< >>`
| | `+ -`
| | `< \<= > >=`
| | `== !=`
| 3+<| `&&` 2+<| `\|\|`
| *Low* 5+<| `= += -= *= /= %= <<= >>= &= ^=`
|===

*Rule 41.* When long expressions are broken down over multiple lines, they shall be broken down just before an operator. Therefore, the first token on the new line shall be an operator. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
return a == b
    && c == d;
----

[NOTE]
When an `? :` expression is broken down over multiple lines, both `?` and `:` shall be the first token on a line. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
Colour c = todayIsMonday
    ? SomeVeryLargeFactoryFunctionThatTranslatesColours(blue)
    : SomeVeryLargeFactoryFunctionThatTranslatesColours(green);
----

*Rule 42.* `{` and `}` shall be the single token in one line (except when `}` is followed by `;`), except when used to define short arrays, when used in a lambda expressions containing only a single statement, and when used in an empty definition. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
class C
{
    std::array<int32_t, 4> a = { 0, 2, 8, 64 };	// <-- short array

    void F()
    {
        Schedule([this]() { F(); });		// <-- lambda function containing only a
    }                                       //     single statement

    void Empty()
    {}			// <-- When nothing is placed between { and }, place them on the same line
};
----

*Rationale 10.*	Closing an empty `{}` on the same line communicates clearly that a class/function/loop is left empty by design. The special pattern of placing them together makes recognition instantaneous.

*Rule 43.* When defining a “Name tag”, where the type defined contains no functionality but only acts as a unique name, place the whole declaration on a single line. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
struct Uart: hal::Uart::Name<Uart> {};
----

== Miscellaneous

*Rule 44.* `#include` statements shall include standard headers in `< >`, and all other headers in `" "`. If a standard C header is needed (such as `<stdlib.h>`), the equivalent C++ header shall be used (`<cstdlib>`). Standard header shall be included after other headers, and (as second ordering criterion) includes shall be alphabetically ordered. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
#include "event/EventHandler.hpp"
#include "util/InterfaceConnector.hpp"
#include "util/Optional.hpp"
#include <array>
#include <cassert>
----

*Rationale 11.*	Placing standard headers after other headers minimizes the chance that a normal header gratuitously includes a standard header; any such omissions are therefore easier to detect.

*Rule 45.* Class data members shall be initialized by the constructor. Note that data members of class type are always initialized and therefore need no explicit initialization. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
struct C
{
    C()
        : member1(0)		// int32_ts are not initialized by default and therefore require
    {}				        // explicit initialization

    int32_t member1;
    int32_t member2 = 3;	// If possible, in-class initialization is preferred since this
};					        // eliminates the need to initialize the member in each constructor
----

*Rule 46.* Stack variables shall be initialized at their point of declaration. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
void F()
{
    int x = 0;
    if (SomeCondition())
        x = 5;
    else
        x = 10;
}
----

*Rule 47.* Multiple `return` statements are preferred in favour of more complex code. A precondition for this is that either the `return` is an early `return` on a precondition check, or the containing function is short, with logic that is easy to follow. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
int32_t Max(int32_t a, int32_t b)
{
    if (a >= b)
        return a;
    else
        return b;
}
----

*Rule 48.* `int32_t` shall be used in favour of `int`. In general, exact-width integer types should be used in favour of types like `short`, `long`, etc.

*Rule 49.* Exact-width integer types shall be used without their `std::` namespace qualification.

*Rule 50.* The `using namespace` directive shall not be used, not even in source files. Except for the `std::literals` namespaces.

*Rationale 12.*	Namespace qualifications improve recognition of symbols. Since source files are not owned by single persons, the same rule applies for source files for consistency.

*Rule 51.* `NULL` and `0` shall not be used as null pointers. Use `nullptr` instead.

*Rule 52.* When overriding `virtual` functions in a derived class, the keywords `override` or `final` shall be used to explicitly declare the function to `override` a base function. The `virtual` keyword shall not be repeated.

*Rule 53.* The `++` and `--` operators shall be written in front of the variable, unless post increment/post decrement is really the intended operation.

*Rule 54.* In pointer and reference declarations, the `*` and `&` are placed adjacent to the type, not to the variable. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
int32_t* x;		// <-- correct
int32_t *x;		// <-- incorrect
----

*Rule 55.* C-style casts shall not be used. Use C++-style casts instead.

*Rationale 13.*	With a C-style cast, multiple (unexpected) casts can be done simultaneously, e.g. a `static_cast` can be combined with a `const_cast`:

[source,cpp]
----
(Derived*)x;		// <-- if the type of x was const Base*, const is unexpectedly cast away.
----

*Rule 56.* The `#pragma once` declaration shall not be used, since this declaration is not part of the C++ standard.

*Rule 57.* Global data shall not be declared `static`. Instead, prefer a static private class member; place data in an unnamed namespace if a static private class member is not a proper solution.

*Rule 58.* In template definitions, `class` is used to denote template type parameters, in favour of typename. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
template<class T>
class X {};
----

*Rationale 14.* While any type can be substituted in a template type parameter, and not just classes, the use of typename can be very misleading when it is used in a template variable parameter to denote that a nested identifier is a typename. For example:

[source,cpp]
----
template<typename StorageName, typename StorageName::Type Value>
class X {};
----

Here, StorageName is a type parameter, while Value is a value parameter, despite the typename in front of the type. It is used like this:

[source,cpp]
----
struct Y
{
    typedef int32_t Type;
};

X<Y, 5> a;
----

So even though both parameters start with typename, the first parameter takes a type while the second parameter takes a value.

*Rule 59.* Treat warnings as errors.

*Rationale 15.* Warnings only help when they draw the attention. If code containing warnings is checked in, warnings will accumulate and drown out new warnings, defeating the purpose of warnings.

*Rule 60.* Disable all senseless warnings without hesitation.

*Rationale 16.* The rules of the C++ language are documented in the C++ standard. In addition to these standard rules, vendors’ hallucinations about what might be unsafe are stacked on top of this, in the form of warnings that change with platform and version, and for which the cure may be worse than the disease. While warnings exist that really help improving quality, many warnings are just white noise. Examples of the latter category are warnings about unused parameters (GCC), and warnings about the use of the standard function `std::copy` (MSVC), with the unhelpful suggestion to use the non-portable and thus unusable `make_checked_array_iterator` extension.

When in doubt, disable each warning that pops up, because our unit tests are far better suited at communicating whether your code is correct or not.

[NOTE]
Platform software such as CMSIS often produces warnings out-of-the-box. Since this code is most often written in C, and since we usually do not write code in C, consider disabling all warnings for the C language.

*Rule 61.* When using the GMock framework, the `EXPECT_*` macros shall be used to state expectations. If a test contains any precondition checks on functionality that is already tested in other tests, the `ASSERT_*` macros shall be used to test the preconditions. Example:

[source,cpp]
----
TEST(MyTest, FirstTest)
{
    EXPECT_TRUE(theWorldIsRound);
}

TEST(MyTest, SecondTest)
{
    ASSERT_TRUE(theWorldIsRound);	 If this does not hold,
 							the purpose of the following test is moot
    EXPECT_TRUE(triangularInequalityHoldsOnEarthsSurface);
}
----
