= SESAME (SErial Secure Adaptable Message Exchange)
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

== Introduction

Microcontrollers often communicate with each other using a UART connection.
Before such a serial connection can be used by the xref:Echo.adoc[ECHO] protocol,
a mechanism is needed to initialize communication and prevent overflowing buffers
on the peer. Furthermore, a means to secure the communication is required.
For these purposes the SESAME protocol stack is developed.

SESAME consists of several layers, first using link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing[COBS] 
to divide the stream of bytes into delimited packets,
second a window protocol to prevent overflowing buffers,
and third (optional) a layer that provides security.

== SESAME layer COBS

The first layer divides the stream of bytes of the serial communication
into a number of packets. As specified by the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing[COBS]
protocol, packets are separated by 0 bytes, and any 0 bytes in the payload
are exchanged for non-0 bytes on the serial communication layer. Please see
the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing[COBS] specification
for details.

== SESAME layer Windowed

Using the Windowed layer, both sides of the communication notify and update their peer of
available window size. A peer can only send packets up to the available window. Four
packet types are defined:

1. Init
2. InitResponse
3. ReleaseWindow
4. Message

=== Init

Sending an Init packet initializes the protocol. An Init packet has one 16-bit unsigned parameter `size`
which specifies the available window size, encoded in little endian order. An Init packet must be responded to with an InitResponse
packet. Before receiving an InitResponse, a peer must assume that no window is available, so
further packets may not be sent.

(draw-box "size" {:span 2})
----

An Init packet consumes no window, and may always be sent. This results in an edge case that an
Init packet sent at an inconvenient moment may overflow the peer's buffer. In that case, that
overflow must result in the peer sending an Init packet of its own. Since a sender
has an empty buffer before sending an Init packet, that will not result in a repeated exchange of
Init packets.

=== InitResponse

When an Init packet has been received, a host will clear its buffer, and advertise available buffer
space using the InitResponse packet. Similar to the Init packet, the InitResponse packet
has one 16-bit unsigned parameter `size` encoded in little endian which advertises available buffer size.

(def boxes-per-row 3)
(draw-column-headers)
(draw-box 2)
(draw-box "size" {:span 2})
----

An InitResponse packet consumes 5 window bytes: 3 for the packet contents, 2 for the 
COBS layer (1 for the COBS overhead byte, one for the terminating 0).

=== ReleaseWindow

When a host has processed incoming packets, and therefore frees up buffer space,
it advertises the freed up space using the ReleaseWindow packet. The ReleaseWindow packet
has one 16-bit unsigned parameter `size` encoded in little endian which specifies the amount of bytes in the buffer
freed up in addition to already known free space.

In order to avoid continuous exchanges of ReleaseWindow packets, hosts should only release
window sizes bigger than 5. When determining the buffer size needed to exchange packets, the
size of the biggest packet should be increased by 5 to accommodate for a ReleaseWindow packet.

=== Message

Data sent by higher protocol layers are sent by Message packets. Each Message packet consumes a window
amount equal to the size of that packet plus the COBS overhead of that specific packet, plus
its terminating 0.

== SESAME layer Secured

This protocol layer provides confidentiality and integrity by encrypting packets and appending
a MAC (Message Authentication Code). Since SESAME is geared towards embedded systems, and is
not intended to be as flexible as a protocol like TLS, for simplicity some very specific choices
are made regarding cryptographic schemes.

Encryption and authentication is done with AES-128 in
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode[GCM] mode. AES-128-GCM requires a 128 bit
key and an 128 bit IV. Both directions of communication require their own unique key.

Each message is encrypted with AES-128-GCM with the key and IV as parameters. This results in
a cyphertext of size equal to the size of the message, plus a 16 byte MAC. Since in GCM IVs may
not be reused, the IV is incremented in a specific way to avoid using the same IV twice: After
each message, treat the IV as a 128-bit unsigned number, and add 2^64^ to it, discarding any overflow.
This way, the protocol can securely handle 2^64^ messages each of size at most 2^64^ before a
re-negotiation of keys is necessary.

Key establishment is not a responsiblity of the Secured layer; but care must be taken that
the same key/IV pair should not be reused for different sessions, since encrypting two messages
using the same key/IV pair will result in the XOR of the bit pattern of those two plaintext
messages to be equal to the XOR of the bit pattern of the two cyphertexts of those messages.

There is one exception to that rule: If the first message sent consists of at least 128 bit of
random data, then security is not compromised. The only information leaked is the XOR of two
times 128 bits of random data, from which an attacker still learns nothing. One possible scheme
of key establishment is therefore to hardcode the four Key and IV values for sending and receiving 
on both hosts, and to choose random new Key/IV values right after initialization.

After each initialization of the lower protocol layers (after receiving the Init packet in the
Windowed layer), keys are reset to their default value, and key negotiation must start over
before other messages are sent.

=== ECHO on SESAME

ECHO is used over SESAME by serializing ECHO messages, dividing those messages into a series
of chunks suitable to send over SESAME (so the maximum buffer size advertised by the peer must
be taken into account), and sending those chunks. On the receiving end, those chunks are reassembled,
and parsed as ECHO messages. Since ECHO is able to handle a continuous stream of data, multiple
ECHO messages being concatenated do not pose any difficulties.

=== Symmetric key establishment over ECHO

Specifying the exact key negotiation scheme is outside of the scope of this specification,
since there are many different situations which require different negotiation schemes. However,
if a key negotiation scheme is used that results in a host communicating to its peer that
a specific Key/IV pair is to be used, then the SymmetricKeyEstablishment ECHO service can be used.
This service has one method ActivateNewKeyMaterial with parameters Key and IV. After receiving this
message, a sender of that message will use those Key/IV for subsequent messages towards the receiver.
A full key negotiation will therefore result in ActivateNewKeyMaterial invocations in both directions.
