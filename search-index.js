coding standard defines various aspects of the contents of C++ source files. The goal is to provide a usable standard from which programmers should only deviate in very specific circumstances. Care shall be taken to not restrict programmers in any way or form, so that new techniques and new insights are not obstructed by this standard. This standard assumes that the programmer writes Clean Code. This influences decisions, for example whether or not multiple return statements are allowed. This standard assumes the use of Standard C++, of which the current version was published in 2014. If a compiler is used that does not support specific constructs in this coding standard, those rules are exempted from compliance. The scope of this coding standard is limited to C++ source and header files. E.g. in C and C# other constructions and de facto conventions exist, and the aim is not to supersede those. Currently, the structure of files in directories is out of scope, since this is often dependent on preferences in specific tools. This may later be standardized. Furthermore, the partitioning of source files into layers like infra, hal, etc. is also out of scope. Tools and libraries used are out of scope. This standard does not force a choice between tools, e.g. between Google Test and CPPUnit. Much of writing a standard on coding rules is making arbitrary decisions. For each decision discussions take place on why another would also work. However, as a complete set of decision, this standard strives to adhere to these principles: Consistency: At the very least, following this standard should result in consistent-looking code. This is important because our brains are wired to very quickly identify known patterns and discern structure. Show importance: Each line of code is constructed by more important and less important parts. Some parts should immediately capture our attention; other parts are details which should minimize interference with more important parts. An example of this is giving business-logic-level classes long names, while giving arguments short names. While there are exceptions to every rule, deviation of this standard should only happen in very specific circumstances where following this standard would obviously result in sub-optimal and non-Clean Code. However, not every rule is intended as a hard definition. In the cases where mere guidelines are presented, should is used, for instance \"namespace names should be short\". In contrast, shall is used in cases where definitions are given, for instance \"Identifiers shall not contain any prefix\". Shall is used instead of must, because it is easier to describe what code should look like than it is to describe programmer’s actions. Writing “programmers must create descriptive identifiers” is more tedious to read and write than “identifiers shall be descriptive”. Table 1 shows the different letter case forms used in identifiers: Table 1. Letter case definitions Name and Example Notes UPPER_CASE Words are separated by underscores. lower_case Words are separated by underscores. MixedCase The identifier is started with an upper case character; each new word starts with an upper case character. No underscores are used. camelCase The identifier is started with a lower case character; each new word starts with an upper case character. No underscores are used. Rule 1. Table 2 defines the letter case of identifiers: Table 2. Identifier letter case Identifier Letter Case Notes Variable name camelCase In C++, there is no separate notion of constants, since they are just variables with the const and static qualifiers. Therefore, they follow the same definition. Function name MixedCase Class name MixedCase Enum name MixedCase Enum members camelCase Enum members function like variables in the sense that they contain values. Therefore, they follow the Variable name definition. Namespace name lower_case Namespace names should be short and only consist of one word. Template parameter MixedCase Both type and value parameters follow this definition. Macro names UPPER_CASE Header include guards NAMESPACE_UPPPER_CASE_HPP Header include guards are macro names, and are therefore written in UPPER_CASE. In addition to that, to ensure uniqueness the namespace is prepended, e.g. INFRA_FUNCTION_HPP. File names MixedCase.cpp/.hpp The extension .hpp is chosen in favour of .h. Atmel Studio does not apply C++ syntax colouring to .h files. Directory names lower_case Rationale 1. Both class names and namespace names define scope. We chose lower_case for namespace in order to visualize the higher importance of class names: In util::ByteRange, util is less important than ByteRange. Rationale 2. File names and directory names follow the same reasoning as Rationale 1: The file name is more important than the directory name, therefore the directory name is written in lower_case and the file name in MixedCase. Rationale 3. Macro names, and only macro names, are written in UPPER_CASE. The C++ Preprocessor creates a special layer on top of the rest of the C++ syntax, which makes macros special in the sense that they do not follow the scoping of namespaces. Therefore, they should be easily recognizable, so UPPER_CASE is chosen, and UPPER_CASE is not used for any other identifier. Rule 2. An exemption exists for member functions of classes that behave like Standard C++ container classes. Member functions of those classes shall be written in lower_case, to conform with requirements placed on containers by the C++ Standard. Rule 3. Identifiers shall not contain any prefix or postfix in the form of s…​, m…​, _ptr, etc. Since we write Clean Code, scope and type of identifiers should be clear from the context. Rule 4. Parameters for which their logical name collides with the name of a class data member shall be used in the following way: void C::Enable(bool enabled) { this->enabled = enabled; } Rule 5. Macros shall not be used to define constants. Rule 6. enum class shall be used to define enums, in order to provide scope to the enum members. Enum members shall not contain a prefix indicating their type. Rule 7. Abbreviations should only be used when the abbreviation is more well-known or more often used than their full name. In C++, larger identifiers are the norm, so abbreviations should be used judiciously. The word used to indicate destination is spelled \"for\", not \"4\"; the word used to indicate direction is spelled \"to\", not \"2\". Rule 8. Acronyms should be considered as one word, so a UART implementation class should be named Uart, and a variable holding an object of that class uart. Rationale 4. If the UART class would be named UART, the name would look like a macro. An example of an actual collision is the case of DMA on the STM32F4xx: The name DMA actually clashes with the macro DMA defined in one of the platform’s headers. Rule 9. Use descriptive names in favour of acronyms, when possible. Example: Queue instead of FIFO. Rule 10. Mimic names from the C++ language when defining similar concepts. Example: Iterator instead of Cursor. Rule 11. Identifiers shall not contain references to project names. Rationale 5. Project names are never descriptive of functionality. For example, there is nothing descriptive about \"WoodstoveFanAlgorithm\". Consider \"LogarithmicFanAlgorithm\" or \"StepwiseFanAlgorithm\" instead. Moreover, source code is reused in spin-off projects; project names are either replaced by the new project’s name which takes effort, or, more likely, the old project names are kept in the identifiers which leads to confusion and legacy. Rule 12. Indentation is a multiple of 4 spaces; tabs are not allowed. Rule 13. Lines of code following the use of { up to the corresponding } are indented. This rule applies even to the first-level namespace. Other coding standards often allow omission of indentation in the first-level namespace, but since we write Clean Code where nesting is never very deep, we can apply Rule 13 consistently. Rule 14. The initialiser list in constructor bodies is indented. Example: Timer::Timer() : registered(false) , nextTriggerTime() {} Rationale 6. The purpose of the indentation in Rule 14 is to make clear that the values initialised are less important than the constructor’s signature. Rule 15. In the declaration of a member template, the signature of the function is indented. If the function is defined outside of the class, it is not indented. Example: class X { template<class T> void F();  This line is indented }; template<class T> void X<T>::F()  This line is not indented {} Rule 16. Expressions spread over multiple lines are indented one step in all lines following the first. Example: a = firstObject.VeryLongFunction(withSomeParameters) + secondObject.SomeOtherFunction() / localValue + otherValue; #ifdef, #if, #else, #elif does not need to be followed by indentation, although there are certain cases where indentation would improve clarity. Rule 17. A logical block consists of lines of code that logically belong together and shall not contain blank lines. Logical blocks are separated from other blocks by one blank line. Rule 18. A blank line shall not be followed by another blank line. Rule 19. A { belongs to the logical block beneath it, and a } belongs to the logical block above it, and shall therefore not be succeeded or preceded by a blank line, respectively. Rule 20. All #include statements form one single logical block. Rule 21. Class members that have similar functionality, e.g. constructors, modifiers like push and pop, or accessors like front and back belong to the same logical block. When a block becomes too big, it should be split up. Data members and member functions shall not be mixed in the same block. Example: class A { public: A(); A(const A& other); A& operator=(const A& other); ~A(); void DoThis(); // A new block starts here, so a blank line precedes here. void DoThat(); // DoThis and DoThat belong together private: int32_t x; int32_t y; bool done; }; Rule 22. Each class definition and each function definition shall be surrounded by blank lines. Rule 23. The elements of the inheritance list and the elements of the initialiser list shall each be placed on a separate line; the : or the , are placed in front of the element. Example: class TriStatePin : public InputPin , public OutputPin { Rule 24. The names of variables in successive declarations shall not be aligned vertically. Rationale 7. Vertical alignment is hard to maintain; the pattern is often broken after addition of new variables, or renaming of existing variables. Moreover, restoring alignment after such an operation modifies non-related lines, which causes unnecessary long diffs and increases conflicts in version control systems. Rule 25. The statements if, for, while, do, and switch shall be followed by a space. Example: if (a) // <-- correct if(a) // <-- incorrect Rule 26. The sub-statements of if, else, for, while, and do shall not be written on the same line as the if, else, for, while, and do statements. Rule 27. The case and default clauses inside a switch statement shall be indented. Example: switch (a) { case 1: // <-- One indent break; // <-- Two indents default: break; } Rule 28. When for, while, or do is followed by an empty sub-statement, {} shall be used in favour of ;. Example: while (buffer[++i] != 0) {} Rule 29. When if, else, for, while, or do is followed by a single statement, {} shall be omitted, except in matching if/else if/else blocks for symmetry. Example: if (a >= b) return a; else return b; if (a >= b) { a += b; return a; } else { return b; } When writing Clean Code, many of these sub statements will consist of a single statement, which often is a single function call. Rule 30. The return type of a function should be placed on the same line as the rest of the function signature, unless the return type is very long. Rule 31. Template specifications shall not be placed on the same line as the function to which they belong. Example: template<class T> void C<T>::F() // <-- Placed on a new line Rule 32. Binary operators shall be surrounded by spaces. Example: a = b + c; // <-- correct a = b+c; // <-- incorrect Rule 33. Unary operators shall be written adjacent to the expression. Example: ++b; // <-- correct ++ b; // <-- incorrect Rule 34. In the declaration of overloaded operator functions, spaces shall be omitted. Example: BigInteger& operator+=(const BigInteger&);  correct BigInteger& operator += (const BigInteger&);  incorrect Rationale 8. In operator overloading, the name of the =` operator is `operator=, as one word. Rule 35. return and throw are statements, not a function, therefore their argument shall not be enclosed in ( ). Rule 36. ( shall not be followed by a space, and ) shall not be preceded by a space. Example: a = (b + c) * d; // <-- correct a = ( b + c ) * d; // <-- incorrect Rule 37. When { and } are used on a single line to define a short array or a single statement lambda expression (see Rule 42) { shall be followed by a space and } shall be preceded by a space. Example: std::array<int32_t, 4> a = { 0, 2, 8, 64 }; Rule 38. When used in template specifications, < and > are not surrounded by spaces. Example: template<class T> void C<T>::F() Rationale 9. With spacing, < > are easily confused with comparison operators. Example: Function0< int32_t > a; // <-- Here, > looks like a comparison operator Rule 39. ( ) shall be used where they increase clarity (in addition to, of course, where they are necessary). They shall be omitted where they do not increase clarity. Rule 40. Operator precedence knowledge is expected of the operators listed in Table 3, which lists operators with their precedence. ( ) should therefore be omitted when Table 3 already defines the precedence. Example: if (((a + b * c < d) && e != f) || a == b) In this example, relative operator precedence of above +, < above , and && above != is well-known and therefore omitted. Although operator precedence of && above < is known, adding ( ) improves readability in this quite long line. Since relative precedence of && and || is not expected to be well-known, ( ) is added around the && arguments. Table 3 indicates this not well-known information by listing && and || in separate cells next to each other. Table 3. Operator Precedence Precedence Operators High ++ -- + - (Unary) * / % & ^ | << >> + - < <= > >= == != && || Low = += -= *= /= %= <⇐ >>= &= ^= Rule 41. When long expressions are broken down over multiple lines, they shall be broken down just before an operator. Therefore, the first token on the new line shall be an operator. Example: return a == b && c == d; When an ? : expression is broken down over multiple lines, both ? and : shall be the first token on a line. Example: Colour c = todayIsMonday ? SomeVeryLargeFactoryFunctionThatTranslatesColours(blue) : SomeVeryLargeFactoryFunctionThatTranslatesColours(green); Rule 42. { and } shall be the single token in one line (except when } is followed by ;), except when used to define short arrays, when used in a lambda expressions containing only a single statement, and when used in an empty definition. Example: class C { std::array<int32_t, 4> a = { 0, 2, 8, 64 }; // <-- short array void F() { Schedule([this]() { F(); }); // <-- lambda function containing only a } // single statement void Empty() {} // <-- When nothing is placed between { and }, place them on the same line }; Rationale 10. Closing an empty {} on the same line communicates clearly that a class/function/loop is left empty by design. The special pattern of placing them together makes recognition instantaneous. Rule 43. When defining a “Name tag”, where the type defined contains no functionality but only acts as a unique name, place the whole declaration on a single line. Example: struct Uart: hal::Uart::Name<Uart> {}; Rule 44. #include statements shall include standard headers in < >, and all other headers in \" \". If a standard C header is needed (such as <stdlib.h>), the equivalent C++ header shall be used (<cstdlib>). Standard header shall be included after other headers, and (as second ordering criterion) includes shall be alphabetically ordered. Example: #include \"event/EventHandler.hpp\" #include \"util/InterfaceConnector.hpp\" #include \"util/Optional.hpp\" #include <array> #include <cassert> Rationale 11. Placing standard headers after other headers minimizes the chance that a normal header gratuitously includes a standard header; any such omissions are therefore easier to detect. Rule 45. Class data members shall be initialized by the constructor. Note that data members of class type are always initialized and therefore need no explicit initialization. Example: struct C { C() : member1(0) // int32_ts are not initialized by default and therefore require {} // explicit initialization int32_t member1; int32_t member2 = 3; // If possible, in-class initialization is preferred since this }; // eliminates the need to initialize the member in each constructor Rule 46. Stack variables shall be initialized at their point of declaration. Example: void F() { int x = 0; if (SomeCondition()) x = 5; else x = 10; } Rule 47. Multiple return statements are preferred in favour of more complex code. A precondition for this is that either the return is an early return on a precondition check, or the containing function is short, with logic that is easy to follow. Example: int32_t Max(int32_t a, int32_t b) { if (a >= b) return a; else return b; } Rule 48. int32_t shall be used in favour of int. In general, exact-width integer types should be used in favour of types like short, long, etc. Rule 49. Exact-width integer types shall be used without their std:: namespace qualification. Rule 50. The using namespace directive shall not be used, not even in source files. Except for the std::literals namespaces. Rationale 12. Namespace qualifications improve recognition of symbols. Since source files are not owned by single persons, the same rule applies for source files for consistency. Rule 51. NULL and 0 shall not be used as null pointers. Use nullptr instead. Rule 52. When overriding virtual functions in a derived class, the keywords override or final shall be used to explicitly declare the function to override a base function. The virtual keyword shall not be repeated. Rule 53. The ++ and -- operators shall be written in front of the variable, unless post increment/post decrement is really the intended operation. Rule 54. In pointer and reference declarations, the * and & are placed adjacent to the type, not to the variable. Example: int32_t* x; // <-- correct int32_t *x; // <-- incorrect Rule 55. C-style casts shall not be used. Use C++-style casts instead. Rationale 13. With a C-style cast, multiple (unexpected) casts can be done simultaneously, e.g. a static_cast can be combined with a const_cast: (Derived*)x; // <-- if the type of x was const Base*, const is unexpectedly cast away. Rule 56. The #pragma once declaration shall not be used, since this declaration is not part of the C++ standard. Rule 57. Global data shall not be declared static. Instead, prefer a static private class member; place data in an unnamed namespace if a static private class member is not a proper solution. Rule 58. In template definitions, class is used to denote template type parameters, in favour of typename. Example: template<class T> class X {}; Rationale 14. While any type can be substituted in a template type parameter, and not just classes, the use of typename can be very misleading when it is used in a template variable parameter to denote that a nested identifier is a typename. For example: template<typename StorageName, typename StorageName::Type Value> class X {}; Here, StorageName is a type parameter, while Value is a value parameter, despite the typename in front of the type. It is used like this: struct Y { typedef int32_t Type; }; X<Y, 5> a; So even though both parameters start with typename, the first parameter takes a type while the second parameter takes a value. Rule 59. Treat warnings as errors. Rationale 15. Warnings only help when they draw the attention. If code containing warnings is checked in, warnings will accumulate and drown out new warnings, defeating the purpose of warnings. Rule 60. Disable all senseless warnings without hesitation. Rationale 16. The rules of the C language are documented in the C standard. In addition to these standard rules, vendors’ hallucinations about what might be unsafe are stacked on top of this, in the form of warnings that change with platform and version, and for which the cure may be worse than the disease. While warnings exist that really help improving quality, many warnings are just white noise. Examples of the latter category are warnings about unused parameters (GCC), and warnings about the use of the standard function std::copy (MSVC), with the unhelpful suggestion to use the non-portable and thus unusable make_checked_array_iterator extension. When in doubt, disable each warning that pops up, because our unit tests are far better suited at communicating whether your code is correct or not. Platform software such as CMSIS often produces warnings out-of-the-box. Since this code is most often written in C, and since we usually do not write code in C, consider disabling all warnings for the C language. Rule 61. When using the GMock framework, the EXPECT_* macros shall be used to state expectations. If a test contains any precondition checks on functionality that is already tested in other tests, the ASSERT_* macros shall be used to test the preconditions. Example: TEST(MyTest, FirstTest) { EXPECT_TRUE(theWorldIsRound); } TEST(MyTest, SecondTest) { ASSERT_TRUE(theWorldIsRound);  If this does not hold, the purpose of the following test is moot EXPECT_TRUE(triangularInequalityHoldsOnEarthsSurface); } Revision Release Date Author Description of changes CR/Reason 6 24-Jun-2016 Richard Peters Update - 7 22-Jun-2022 Ron Jaegers Ported from Word to AsciiDoc - This section contains a Cheat Sheet; i.e. nonsensical code written for the purpose of demonstrating the rules.

While the C++ standard template library contains several containers like std::vector and std::set, the storage of these containers is allocated on the heap. In embedded applications, more control over the storage is desired. For this reason, the infra package contains two types of containers: the Bounded containers and the Intrusive containers. While their storage is not on the heap, the interfaces of these containers closely mimic the interfaces of the standard containers. The first strategy to deal with storage in containers is by allocating memory inside the containers themselves. The size of a container therefore includes the storage of its elements. The maximum number of elements to be stored is passed as a template parameter to the instantiation of the container, e.g. infra::BoundedVector<int>::WithMaxSize<5> myVector declares a container myVector which holds up to 5 integers. Since the size of the storage is known up front, the maximum number of elements that can be placed in the container is bounded, hence their name. The Bounded counterparts of the containers of the standard library are the following: Bounded Container Standard Container infra::BoundedVector<T>::WithMaxSize<N> std::vector<T> infra::BoundedDeque<T>::WithMaxSize<N> std::deque<T> infra::BoundedString<T>::WithStorage<N> std::string<T> infra::BoundedPriorityQueue<T, N> std::priority_queue<T> infra::BoundedList<T>::WithMaxSize<N> std::list<T> infra::BoundedForwardList<T>::WithMaxSize<N> std::forward_list<T> These bounded containers conform to the same specifications as placed by the C++ standard on their counterparts where possible, so they generally have the same constructors, accessors, types, and complexity requirements. One notable omission is the allocator passed to standard containers, since bounded containers allocate their elements inside their own space. These containers have two additional accessors: std::size_t max_size() and bool full(). While the intention of this document is not to repeat the documentation available on standard containers, for quick reference a summary of available functions is given here: Method Description bool empty() Returns true if and only if the container is empty std::size_t size() Returns the number of currently held elements iterator begin() Returns an iterator to the first element iterator end() Returns an iterator which points to one past the last element void clear() Removes all elements void push_back(element) Inserts one element to the back void push_front(element) Inserts one element to the front void emplace_back(…​) Constructs one element at the back, parameters are forwarded to the constructor of the element void emplace_front(…​) Constructs one element at the front, parameters are forwarded to the constructor of the element void pop_back() Removes one element from the back void pop_front() Removes one element from the front iterator insert(position, element) Inserts an element at the given position iterator erase(position) Removes an element at the given position Often, the class that holds a container of elements is not the class that makes the decision on how big that container should be. For example, the UrlRouter holds a BoundedVector for storing the PageServers to which it refers. It doesn’t know, however, whether it should be able to hold 2, 10, or 500 PageServers. Allocating too much space would be wasteful; but at the place in the code where the UrlRouter is instantiated this limit is known. In order to specify the maximum storage for a container at a later moment, BoundedVector<T> (and similarly other containers) may be created as a reference to a BoundedVector<T>::WithStorage<N>. By constructing the actual BoundedVector at the point of instantiation of UrlRouter, the choice for the maximum number of elements is delayed. For example: class UrlRouter { public: explicit UrlRouter(infra::BoundedVector<PageServer>& storage); protected: infra::BoundedVector<PageServer>& pageServers; }; The UrlRouter can now be instantiated as follows: infra::BoundedVector<PageServer>::WithMaxSize<10> storage; UrlRouter router(storage); The UrlRouter now uses a BoundedVector with a maximum size of 10 elements. In order to simplify instantiation of the UrlRouter, it uses the infra::WithStorage helper class to feed a constructed BoundedVector to the UrlRouter. Using this WithMaxSize parameter, instantiation is simplified to: class UrlRouter { public: template<std::size_t Max> using WithMaxSize = infra::WithStorage<UrlRouter, infra::BoundedVector<PageServer>::WithMaxSize<Max>>; explicit UrlRouter(infra::BoundedVector<PageServer>& storage); protected: infra::BoundedVector<PageServer>& pageServers; }; UrlRouter::WithMaxSize<10> router; Another approach for storing elements in a container is to not allocate additional storage for an object, but to make the user of a container responsible for storage allocation. By adding some additional administration to an object, a container can keep track of its objects by jumping from object to object via that additional administration. For instance, objects used in an infra::IntrusiveForwardList each have a next pointer, so that when the container keeps track of its first element it can enumerate all its elements by following the next pointer. In order to inject the administration into elements, the elements derive from container::NodeType. The container’s administration therefore intrudes into the element, hence their name Intrusive containers. A consequence of this is that an element can only be assigned to one container at a time, but unlike the Bounded containers, Intrusive containers cannot become full. Like the Bounded containers, the infra package contains counterparts of containers found in the standard library that closely mimic their behaviour. The provided Intrusive containers are: Intrusive Container Standard Container infra::IntrusiveForwardList<T> std::forward_list<T> infra::IntrusiveList<T> std::list<T> infra::IntrusivePriorityQueue<T, Compare> std::priority_queue<T, Compare> infra::IntrusiveSet<T, Compare> std::set<T, Compare> One standard container of note is std::array<T, Size>. This container does not use the heap and has a fixed size. It is a drop-in replacement of the C array, with a C++ interface. When a container of a fixed-size is needed, std::array should be used.","title":"Containers","component":"embedded_infrastructure_library","version":"8.0.0","name":"Containers","url":"/embedded_infrastructure_library/8.0.0/Containers.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Bounded Containers","hash":"_bounded_containers","id":2},{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":3},{"text":"References to Bounded Containers","hash":"_references_to_bounded_containers","id":4},{"text":"Intrusive Containers","hash":"_intrusive_containers","id":5},{"text":"std::array","hash":"_stdarray","id":6}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"ECHO is the name of the embedded remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism used in the Embedded Infrastructure Library. As an RPC mechanism, it provides mechanisms and tools to easily communicate with remote targets. ECHO builds on top of Google Protocol Buffers (Protobuf), which is chosen because, as a Google standard, it already has wide adoption in the world, with many programming languages being supported. Adding support for new languages is simplified by Google thanks to its flexible Protobuf compiler. In this document, we assume familiarity with the concepts of Protobuf such as its basic types, messages, and services. This document describes the additions and restrictions on the Protobuf messages; the translation from Protobuf services to a binary protocol; and running the compiler plug-ins that generate C++, C# and Java code, which serves as an example to write a Protobuf compiler plug-in for other languages. The .proto files, which contain a description of all messages and services, use the proto3 syntax. Information about Google Protocol Buffers can be found at Protocol Buffers. Since ECHO builds on top of Protobuf, Google’s definition of messages and translation of messages to a binary format is used. Protobuf defines a mechanism to add options to messages, which is used by ECHO to place upper limits on otherwise unbounded messages, so that on embedded platforms a known amount of memory can be reserved for specific messages. For example, a message to hold a time zone locale (which has a maximum length of 32) may look like this: message TimeLocale { string timezone = 1 [(string_size) = 32]; } Three entities in proto files are unbounded: fields of type string, fields of type bytes, and repeated fields. The options describing their upper limit are string_size, bytes_size, and array_size. Repeated strings are defined as follows: repeated string deviceUrls = 3 [(string_size) = 128, (array_size) = 2]; The options string_size, bytes_size, and array_size are defined in EchoAttributes.proto, which is part of this specification, and attached as appendix. Since in the generated embedded code these size attributes are used in the definition of the fields of messages, the limits on these fields are observed by design. Other languages/implementations may use introspection mechanisms to ensure that the limits are observed, or they may be made compliant by design; in any way, the limits may not be surpassed, otherwise results of communication are unpredictable. A service defined in Protobuf consist of a number of methods. Protobuf does not define the encoding/decoding rules, so this document fully defines this translation. Some RPC systems (like Google’s gRPC) use the name of the services and methods to make the call. Since ECHO is intended to be used in an embedded context, instead of using the names of services and methods options are used to assign identifiers to services and methods. Those options are defined in EchoAttributes.proto, and are used like this: service TestInteraction { option (service_id) = 11; rpc Reset(Nothing) returns (Nothing) { option (method_id) = 1; } } In ECHO, all messages are asynchronous. This is done for two reasons: 1) Without having to wait for a response, a sender can send many messages in quick succession, thereby fully utilizing network buffers. The receiver can then pre-process the next message when still executing the previous message; 2) Embedded applications without multiple threads often have other (real time) tasks to accomplish. Having to wait for a result of a message may complicate the execution model. ECHO introduces a limitation on Protobuf interfaces: Since all messages are assumed to be asynchronous, all messages must return Nothing. All Protobuf methods take one message as parameter. When designing a method with one or more parameters, a message is created containing those parameters. When a method takes no data as input, the Nothing type is used, which results in the generated code containing no parameters (If a custom empty message would be used, generated methods would take one parameter of that type, even though it contains no fields). The Reset method in the example above therefore takes Nothing as parameter, which results in generation of a void Reset() function. ECHO uses a reliable data stream to communicate, like TCP, so that correct ordering and delivery is guaranteed until a disconnect occurs. When a service’s method is invoked, the data is encoded as follows: <serviceId> <(methodId << 3) | 2> <length> <message> The serviceId, adjusted methodId, and length are encoded as Protobuf varints. The methodId is adjusted so that the combination of methodId, length, and message is the same as a Protobuf field where the methodId is the field number, and the message is the contents. So it is equivalent to: <serviceId> <field(methodId, message)> which is easier for some encoders/decoders. The Google Protobuf compiler is able to generate code for a number of languages, including C++, C#, Java, and Python. This generated code can encode and decode the Protobuf messages defined in .proto files. Support for ECHO communication using the services must be added on top of that using a compiler plug-in. Such a compiler plug-in is written in your favourite language, and it is invoked by the Protobuf compiler. It is fed a Protobuf message on stdin, which completely defines the interpreted .proto file, and on stdout the plug-in outputs a Protobuf message which completely defines the resulting code. The compiler takes care of the rest. This means that a compiler plug-in immediately deals with an abstract syntax tree containing all interpreted information about the .proto file, so that it can fully focus on the form of the output, instead of on parsing the input. If a language is targeted which is supported by the Protobuf compiler, then the compiler plug-in for that language only needs to generate code for the services, which consists of encoding and decoding services’ methods and their parameters. If an unsupported language is targeted, then the compiler plug-in also has to generate code for encoding and decoding the individual message. All files should be ordered in the following manner: Syntax Imports (sorted) Package Everything else All namings should be consistent and easy to read.

This is a lightweight way of being able to perform multiple tasks in parallel, without needing multiple stacks or synchronization. The event dispatcher is used by scheduling an action by using its Schedule() method. Schedule() takes a single argument of type infra::Function<void()>, and is therefore often used in combination with lambda functions. Schedule() does not execute its action immediately, but pushes it on a queue for later execution. The event dispatcher is typically constantly running on the application’s main thread, and executes queued actions one after another. This way, a scheduled action is completely finished before the next action is started, so in contrast with running actions in different threads no synchronization is needed. An action executed by an event dispatcher should never waste any time; no action should ever sleep, waiting for an external task, such as a write towards flash, to finish. Instead, after having started a write towards flash, a new action is scheduled when the write has been finished. In the meantime, other actions can execute. This creates a decoupling between various different pieces of business logic: while one piece is busy with writing to flash, another piece may be answering an HTTP request, or reading out a temperature sensor. No real-time behaviour is guaranteed on the event dispatcher (any real-time behaviour required is implemented outside of event dispatchers, by either interrupt handlers or by using threads), but multiple components can flawlessly share execution time, with each component making steady progress. While it is possible to have multiple event dispatchers (when using multiple threads, a specific thread may have its own event dispatcher for dedicated tasks), there is one event dispatcher globally available via infra::EventDispatcher::Instance(). This event dispatcher is used for generic tasks; for example, the ConfigurationStore uses the Flash interface to read and write towards flash; the completion of a read or write action is dispatched on this globally available event dispatcher. A typical main function will therefore start with declaring an event dispatcher, and end with invoking that event dispatcher’s Run() method. Objects that are managed by shared pointers may schedule actions to be executed, but it may happen that that object is destroyed before that action is executed. In that case, that action should be discarded instead of being executed. infra::EventDispatcherWithWeakPtr exists to facilitate this usecase. Next to the typical Schedule() function that takes an action as parameter, it supports an overload that takes a second parameter: an infra::WeakPtr<T> towards the object that schedules the action. That parameter is converted to a shared pointer just before executing the action: if this conversion succeeds, the object is still alive, and the action is executed with that shared pointer as parameter. If the conversion fails, then the object was already expired, and execution of that action is skipped. While currently no component in Embedded Infrastructure Library requires the usage of multiple threads, it is perfectly viable to use an operating system to start more than one thread. A reason to use multiple threads include having a dedicated thread for executing tasks that require real-time behaviour. By separating execution of the event dispatcher and execution of time-critical tasks, enough execution time can be guaranteed for real-time behaviour. Another reason for using multiple threads is when a certain action takes a considerable amount of time, for instance generating a certificate takes multiple seconds. Executing that action on the main event dispatcher would delay the execution of other actions; a solution to this could be to generate the certificate in its own thread, and its completion can be scheduled on the main event dispatcher. A thread may have its own event dispatcher. This removes the need for starting and stopping a thread; when a thread-aware event dispatcher is idle, it will pause its thread, and it will wake up its thread when new work is scheduled. Some applications do not benefit from having an event dispatcher. A boot loader’s main focus is to be small and execute one thing; it only loads an application and therefore has no need to execute multiple actions in parallel. The small overhead that an event dispatcher brings does not bring any benefits, and should therefore not be needed in a boot loader. For this kind of usecase, variations of the interfaces for interacting with peripherals exist which work synchronously; they do not need to schedule their completion on an event dispatcher, but they complete their activities before returning. While for other libraries this is often the default behaviour, for Embedded Infrastructure Library this is the exception. A number of components in Embedded Infrastructure Library assume the presence of an event dispatcher. This includes any component that makes use of an asynchronous interface. Obviously, without an event dispatcher such components cannot be used.","title":"Execution Model","component":"embedded_infrastructure_library","version":"8.0.0","name":"ExecutionModel","url":"/embedded_infrastructure_library/8.0.0/ExecutionModel.html","titles":[{"text":"Execution by using an event dispatcher","hash":"_execution_by_using_an_event_dispatcher","id":1},{"text":"Support for infra::WeakPtr","hash":"_support_for_infraweakptr","id":2},{"text":"Multi-threaded execution","hash":"_multi_threaded_execution","id":3},{"text":"Execution without an event dispatcher","hash":"_execution_without_an_event_dispatcher","id":4}]},"5":{"id":5,"text":"Embedded applications regularly handle blocks of memory. Such memory may either be typed (for example, consisting of a number of characters) or un-typed. Traditionally, blocks of memory are handled by having a pointer to its first element and a separate size. Since passing around two separate but related parameters is cumbersome at best and error-prone at its worst, we have improved on dealing with blocks of memory by introducing the class template MemoryRange. A MemoryRange is an object which defines a block of memory with a start and an end, and which has a number of functions that makes dealing with those blocks as a whole easier. This approach reduces the potential for buffer overflows, since while it is easy to shrink a block or to split it; it is much more difficult to create a larger block, thereby overflowing the original block of memory. The MemoryRanges that are most often used are MemoryRange<uint8_t>, which has an alias ByteRange, and its const counterpart ConstByteRange which aliases to MemoryRange<const uint8_t>. Everywhere where untyped memory is used ByteRange or ConstByteRange is used to define where the data resides in memory. For example: the SPI interface SendData method takes a ConstByteRange parameter specifying the data which should be sent. A MemoryRange does not include the storage it points to. Modifying a MemoryRange does not modify the storage. If storage is needed, std::array is a good candidate. After creating a std::array and filling it with data, a MemoryRange can be constructed from it by using MakeRange, after which the MemoryRange can be used for passing around the data. These are the most used accessors of MemoryRange: Method Description begin() Returns a pointer to the first element of the data end() Returns a pointer to one position beyond the last element of the data empty() Returns true if and only if size() == 0 size() Returns the number of elements pointed to: end() - begin() pop_front(num) Remove num elements from the front of the range pop_back(num) Remove num elements from the back of the range shrink_from_front_to(newSize) If size() > newSize, pop elements from the front until size() == newSize shrink_from_back_to(newSize) If size() > newSize, pop elements from the back until size() == newSize In addition to the members of MemoryRange, a number of helper functions exist: Function Description MakeRange(…​) Convert the parameter(s) to a MemoryRange.

A Connection object represents the network towards which data is sent or received, a ConnectionObserver represents the application side handling sent or received data. For example, the C++ wrapper for Lightweight IP provides a class ConnectionLwIP which derives from Connection; the HttpClientImpl class derives from ConnectionObserver, since HttpClientImpl interprets received data, parses HTTP headers, and forwards body data. The lifetime of a Connection/ConnectionObserver pair is under control of the network stack, since the network stacks knows when a connection is alive and when it is terminated. The Connection object therefore derives from SharedOwnedObserver, which holds a SharedPtr to its SharedOwningSubject, which is the ConnectionObserver. When a connection is closed, the Connection object is destructed, and thereby releases its control over its ConnectionObserver, which typically results in the ConnectionObserver being destructed. The methods on Connection and ConnectionObserver for sending and receiving data are geared towards asynchronous behaviour and as little copying as possible. By having fully asynchronous behaviour, the need for threads and/or blocking waits is completely avoided, and one application can easily handle multiple connections, in parallel with SPI transfers, UART communication, etc. without the need for locks or wasting MCU time on busy waits.

Before such a serial connection can be used by the ECHO protocol, a mechanism is needed to initialize communication and prevent overflowing buffers on the peer. Furthermore, a means to secure the communication is required. For these purposes the SESAME protocol stack is developed. SESAME consists of several layers, first using COBS (Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing) to divide the stream of bytes into delimited packets, second a window protocol to prevent overflowing buffers, and third (optional) a layer that provides security. The first layer divides the stream of bytes of the serial communication into a number of packets. The purpose of this is to present well-defined packets to higher layers in the SESAME stack, where those higher layers can then define packet formats. As specified by the COBS protocol, packets are separated by 0 bytes. This means that any 0 bytes inside the payload must be replaced. This is done by adding a first byte to the payload, which points to the first 0 byte in the payload. That 0 byte is then replaced by the index of the next 0 byte, etc. If no 0 byte is present within 254 bytes is present then an extra overhead byte is inserted. Please see the COBS specification for details. Using the Windowed layer, both sides of the communication notify and update their peer of available window size. A peer can only send packets up to the available window. Four packet types are defined: Init InitResponse ReleaseWindow Message Sending an Init packet initializes the protocol. An Init packet has one 16-bit unsigned parameter size which specifies the available window size, encoded in little endian order. An Init packet must be responded to with an InitResponse packet. Before receiving an InitResponse, a peer must assume that no window is available, so further packets may not be sent. Figure 1. Init packet An Init packet consumes no window, and may always be sent. This results in an edge case resulting in an overflow, which works like this: Peer A sends an Init packet at an inconvenient moment. That packet may overflow peer B’s buffer. In that case, that overflow must result in peer B concluding that an Init packet has been received; it can then respond with an Init packet of its own, advertising its available window, and then reading peer A’s window size from its InitResponse packet. This way, the data lost in the overflown Init packet is retrieved. Since a sender has an empty buffer before sending an Init packet, that will not result in a repeated exchange of Init packets. When an Init packet has been received, a host will clear its buffer, and advertise available buffer space using the InitResponse packet. Similar to the Init packet, the InitResponse packet has one 16-bit unsigned parameter size encoded in little endian which advertises available buffer size. Figure 2. InitResponse packet An InitResponse packet consumes 5 window bytes: 3 for the packet contents, 2 for the COBS layer (1 for the COBS overhead byte, one for the terminating 0). When a host has processed incoming packets, and therefore frees up buffer space, it advertises the freed up space using the ReleaseWindow packet. The ReleaseWindow packet has one 16-bit unsigned parameter size encoded in little endian which specifies the amount of bytes in the buffer freed up in addition to already known free space. Figure 3. ReleaseWindow packet Data sent by higher protocol layers are sent by Message packets. Each Message packet consumes a window amount equal to the size of that packet plus the COBS overhead of that specific packet, plus its terminating 0. Figure 4. Message packet When implementing the Window layer, there are a few considerations: In order to avoid continuous exchanges of ReleaseWindow packets, hosts should only release window sizes bigger than 5. When determining the buffer size needed to exchange packets, the size of the biggest packet should be increased by 5 to accommodate for a ReleaseWindow packet. A sender should only send a message when enough window remains to also send a a ReleaseWindow packet. Otherwise, if both peers consume each other’s window, the protocol would enter a deadlock since neither peer is allowed to send a ReleaseWindow packet. If enough buffer space is available, a sender should avoid consuming the entire peer’s buffer with one message. This would result in the sender sending a big message, the peer processing that message and responding with a window release message, for which the sender had to wait until it sends its next message. Instead, a sender should send packets of only half the peer’s window size at a time. This enables the peer to process the packet, and send a window release while the sender is sending the next message. This protocol layer provides confidentiality and integrity by encrypting packets and appending a MAC (Message Authentication Code). Since SESAME is geared towards embedded systems, and is not intended to be as flexible as a protocol like TLS, for simplicity some very specific choices are made regarding cryptographic schemes. Encryption and authentication is done with AES-128 in GCM mode. AES-128-GCM requires a 128 bit key and an 128 bit Initialisation Vector (IV). Both directions of communication require their own unique key/IV pair. Each message is encrypted with AES-128-GCM with the key and IV as parameters. This results in a cyphertext of size equal to the size of the message, plus a 16 byte MAC. Following the recommendation in NIST SP800-38D section 5.2.1.1, the length of the IV is 12 bytes. Since in GCM IVs may not be reused, the IV is incremented for each message to avoid using the same IV twice: After each message, treat the IV as a 96-bit unsigned Big Endian number, and add 1 to it (discarding any overflow). This way, the protocol can securely handle 296 messages each of size at most 239 bytes before a re-negotiation of keys is necessary. Key establishment is not a responsiblity of the Secured layer; but care must be taken that the same key/IV pair should not be reused for different sessions, since encrypting two messages using the same key/IV pair will result in the XOR of the bit pattern of those two plaintext messages to be equal to the XOR of the bit pattern of the two cyphertexts of those messages. There is one exception to that rule: If the first message sent consists of at least 128 bits of random data, then security is not compromised. The only information leaked is the XOR of two times 128 bits of random data, from which an attacker still learns nothing. One possible scheme of key establishment is therefore to hardcode the four Key and IV values for sending and receiving on both hosts, and to choose random new Key/IV values right after initialization. After each initialization of the lower protocol layers (after receiving the Init packet in the Windowed layer), keys are reset to their default value, and key negotiation must start over before other messages are sent. Many differrent ways exist to establish which keys the peers are going to use for the Secured layer; which scheme to use heavily depends on the context in which SESAME is used. Two schemes are defined in this specification. Both peers can be configured with hardcoded keys when implementers are confident that attackers can not extract those keys from the microcontrollers in which SESAME is implemented. A fixed key/IV pair is chosen for sending data from peer A to peer B, and a fixed key/IV pair is chosen for sending data from peer B to peer A. However, as indicated before, care must be taken to not send two messages under the same key. Therefore, before sending any other messages, each peer generates a new random key/IV pair, and uses the ActivateNewKeyMaterial method of the SymmetricKeyEstablishment ECHO service (see appendix) to send this pair to their peer. Upon reception of this method, a peer uses the presented key/IV pair for encryption of subsequent messages that it sends. In this scheme, a host does not need to be pre-programmed with the keys used by its peer. Instead, the Diffie-Hellman scheme is used to have the two peers negotiate the required key/IV pairs. In order to withstand man-in-the-middle attacks, the key exchange messages are signed, and the signature of a received key exchange message is verified by the receiving party. The messages used for exchanging the Diffie-Hellman messages and certificates are sent over ECHO. Obviously, symmetric keys have not yet been established at that point. The secure layer is therefore configured with keys and IVs that consist of all zeroes. Implementations must take care that before the keys and IVs of the secure layer are replaced by the result of Diffie-Hellman key exchange are the only ECHO messages exchanged are of the Diffie-Hellman protocol. In order to verify the signature, a party must either have the certificate of its peer, or have a root certificate by which the peer’s certificate’s validity is checked. In the latter case, a peer will use the PresentCertificate method of the DiffieHellmanKeyEstablishment ECHO service to inform its peer of a certificate to be used. A certificate is either presented in PEM or in DER format. A party will verify each certificate presented in this way by validating it against either one of the installed root certificates, or one of the earlier presented certificates. After any certificate exchange, a party will generate a new Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman public/private key pair on the 256-bit curve defined by FIPS 186-5 and SEC1 (SECP256R1). It will then encode its public key (which is a point of the elliptic curve) in the 65-byte uncompressed representation as defined in SEC1 paragraph 2.3.3. It then uses ECDSA on the same SECP256R1 curve to compute the signature values r and s. After computing the public/private key and the signatures, it sends the public key and the r and s values using the Exchange method of the DiffieHellmanKeyEstablishment ECHO interface to its peer. Upon reception, the peer uses the public key included in the received certificate to check the signature r and s of the presented public key. If this signature is correct, it computes the shared secret using its own private key and the peer’s public key using the Diffie-Hellman scheme. Key expansion is performed on the shared secret to generate enough material for the required key/IV pairs in this way: HMAC-DRBG-SHA256 is seeded with the shared secret, and generates 2 times 128 + 96 bits of data. The first 128 bits of data is KeyA, the next 96 bits is IVA, then 128 bits for KeyB, then 96 bits for IVB. Both parties perform a lexicographical compare of their Diffie-Hellman public keys. The party with public key that compares greater than the public key of its peer uses KeyA and IVA for sending data, the other party uses KeyB and IVB for sending data. When key exchange is done, both parties can start sending other ECHO data than the key exchange messages. ECHO is used over SESAME by serializing ECHO messages, dividing those messages into a series of chunks suitable to send over SESAME (so the maximum buffer size advertised by the peer must be taken into account), and sending those chunks. On the receiving end, those chunks are reassembled, and parsed as ECHO messages. Since ECHO is able to handle a continuous stream of data, multiple ECHO messages being concatenated do not pose any difficulties. This sequence diagram shows a typical sequence of the SESAME protocol being initialized and a message being sent. The Secured layer is left out in this sequence. Figure 5.

For example, infra::Function<void()> f; declares a function object f that has a void return-type and no parameters. infra::Function<int(char x)> g; declares a function object g that has an int return-type and one parameter of type char. Examples: Function<void()> f = [this]() { Trigger(); }; if (f) f(); // Call the lambda function which calls this->Trigger f = nullptr; // Clear the function Since no heap is used, all data used by the function object must be stored inside Function itself. The amount of data necessary is not known upfront, so the Function is parameterized with an ExtraSize parameter to reserve storage. For example, this lambda expression requires no storage: []() {} while this expression requires 8 bytes of extra storage on a 32-bit platform: [this, &x]() { DoSomething(x); }. Function<void()> f = [this, &x]() { DoSomething(x); }; // Compile error, too much storage is needed Function<void(), 2 * sizeof(void*)> g = [this, &x]() { DoSomething(x); }; // Ok.","title":"amp-embedded-infra-lib","component":"embedded_infrastructure_library","version":"8.0.0","name":"index","url":"/embedded_infrastructure_library/8.0.0/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":2},{"text":"infra","hash":"_infra","id":3},{"text":"util","hash":"_util","id":4},{"text":"infra::BoundedString","hash":"_infraboundedstring","id":5},{"text":"infra::CyclicBuffer","hash":"_infracyclicbuffer","id":6},{"text":"infra::Function","hash":"_infrafunction","id":7}]}},"components":{},"componentVersions":{"embedded_infrastructure_library/8.0.0":{"displayVersion":"8.0.0","title":"Embedded Infrastructure Library documentation","version":"8.0.0","name":"embedded_infrastructure_library","asciidoc":{"attributes":{"env":"site","env-site":"","site-gen":"antora","site-gen-antora":"","attribute-missing":"warn","data-uri":null,"icons":"font","sectanchors":"","source-highlighter":"highlight.js","site-title":"Embedded Infrastructure Library","site-url":"https://philips-software.github.io/amp-embedded-infra-lib/","kroki-server-url":"http://kroki:8000","plantuml-server-url":"http://plantuml:8080","kroki-fetch-diagram":true},"sourcemap":false,"extensions":[{}]},"url":"/embedded_infrastructure_library/8.0.0/index.html","navigation":[{"items":[{"content":"Execution Model","url":"/embedded_infrastructure_library/8.0.0/ExecutionModel.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"MemoryRange","url":"/embedded_infrastructure_library/8.0.0/MemoryRange.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Containers","url":"/embedded_infrastructure_library/8.0.0/Containers.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Echo","url":"/embedded_infrastructure_library/8.0.0/Echo.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Sesame","url":"/embedded_infrastructure_library/8.0.0/Sesame.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"NetworkConnections","url":"/embedded_infrastructure_library/8.0.0/NetworkConnections.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Coding Standard","url":"/embedded_infrastructure_library/8.0.0/CodingStandard.html","urlType":"internal"}],"root":true,"order":0}]}}}})
